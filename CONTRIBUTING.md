    - May only be accepted if it is **cleanly partitioned** (e.g. an optional plugin, external submodule, or separately distributed component) and approved by maintainers.  
    - Such components must be clearly marked with their own license file and integration boundaries.  
  - All other contributions must be compatible with the BSD-2 license. If in doubt, open an issue before submitting.
