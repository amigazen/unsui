This directroy contains changed source files, taken from the GCC lib
(written, maintained and collected by Jwahar Bammi).

!! Refer to the file `patchlev.h' for the Patchlevel of the used lib !!


stat.c
	Many file functions call the internal routine `_do_stat()'.
	If you don't need `stat()', it's unnecessary to link this
	function, too.
	Good sideeffect: the function `unixtime()' and other function
	for unixtime() are not linked to the executable!

unx2dos.c
	I have reported an error to bammi in `_canon()', which can cause
	funny things (the stack gets destroyed!!), if a file- or directory-
        name is longer than NAME_MAX characters.
	bammi rejected an additional overflow comparison as `Pascalism',
 	but I think that a too long filename shouldn't cause a crash or
        other things! (Especially if this routine is used as interface
	function between extended filenames and TOS.. and the last one
	allows long filenames without crash!)
