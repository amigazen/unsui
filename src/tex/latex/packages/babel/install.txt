                           Babel Installation Guide
 
                                  5 July 1995


        When you install the babel system you have first to decide
        whether you want to make a new format file. If you don't, you
        miss some of the functionality of the babel system, but you
        can then skip steps 2 through 6 . If you do want to build a
        new format, start with step 1.

        When you want to produce the full listing of all the source
        files in the babel system run babel.drv through LaTeX, then
        use MakeIndex to produce babel.ind using bbind.ist as a style
        file and use MakeIndex to produce babel.glo using bbglo.ist as
        a style file. Then run LaTeX on babel.drv again.

        When you want to use the babel system with plain TeX you will
        have to produce slightly different stripped files. Add the
        `compat' option to each line in the file babel.ins.

        1 Make sure that you have the Docstrip (version 2) program
          available (it is part of the LaTeX2e distribution);  then
          run the file babel.ins through TeX. 
          This strips all the .dtx files of the comments and produces
          fast loadable versions of the files. It will tell that you
          have to move the resulting .sty and .def files into a
          directory where TeX can find them.
          Do that now.

          Docstrip also produces two files called babel.drv and
          user.drv. You can use babel.drv to produce the full
          documented source listing of the babel system. (Which is
          also provided as babel.dvi) You can use user.drv to produce
          a short document that describes the features of each
          language specific file.

        2 Make sure you have the hyphenation patterns available for
          the languages that you intend to use. If you don't have
          them, you may be able to find them in CTAN, in the directory:
          /tex-archive/language/hyphenation.
          If you happen to have a set of patterns that is not
          available there you could make it available by either
          putting it in the /incoming directory or sending it to me.

        3 Make sure that the iniTeX you are using has a sufficiently
          large trie_size and trie_op_size to be able to process all
          the hyphenation patterns that you wish to load into your
          format. If you can recompile TeX, do so (with enlarged
          parameters) if you need more than one or two languages.

        4 The docstripping process will have produced a file called
          hyphen.cfg. This file will be loaded when you build a
          LaTeX format. To build a plain format with the babel system
          preloaded you should make sure that the standard file
          `hyphen.tex' has a different name. You could for instance
          rename it to UShyphen.tex, to indicate American English
          hyphenation patterns.

        5 Check the hyphenation patterns that you have available and
          want to load into the format. For each language that you
          want to hyphenate correctly you need a hyphenation pattern.
          List them all in the file `language.dat'. The file that is
          in the distribution serves as an example of what you have to
          put in there.
          **NOTE The file language.dat that is in the distribution
          ** loads hyphen.tex for english. When you want to use babel
          ** with plain TeX you will have to rename the file
          ** hyphen.tex and therefore you will have to change
          ** language.dat to reflect that change.

        6 Run iniTeX, telling it to load your favorite macro package
          (ie plain or latex).
          When you build a LaTeX format iniTeX will find the file
          hyphen.cfg (provided that you have stored it in the
          correct place).
          When you build a plain TeX format iniTeX tries to find
          hyphen.tex. If you have renamed or moved that file iniTeX
          will tell you that the file can't be found and ask you for a
          different name. Enter `hyphen.cfg' at this point.
          If you haven't renamed or moved hyphen.tex the format will be
          built *without* the babel code.

          *Beware*: some implementations of TeX only look in the
          current directory when the \openin primitive is used. If
          your TeX does that you need to put the file `languages.dat'
          in the same directory where you build your format.
