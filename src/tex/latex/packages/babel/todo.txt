Things that still need to be done (1995/07/05) :
================================================

- Process bug-reports

- Reimplement the support for the use of cyrillic fonts for LaTeX2e.
  For this reason russian.sty is not part of this release.

- Add slovakian quotatian characters,
  as suggested by Jana Chlebikova:
  we have another quotation characters as in English. The opening
  quotation character is similar to Polish opening quotation (see
  Proceedings from EUROTEX'92, pages 125) and closing quotation
  characters is similar as German cl. quat. For ilustration I send you
  macros (from another slovak.sty) with this things. In that sty you
  can use both (english and slovak quotations marks) depending on the
  value \csprimeon or \csprimeoff.  I think, it is a good idea and
  macro looks quite nice. According me something similar is neccesery
  to do in babel-slovak.sty.

- Implement the suggestions for italian.sty from Claudio Beccari
