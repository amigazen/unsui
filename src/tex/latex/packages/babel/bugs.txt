ERROR REPORTS

Before you report an error please check that:

 * The error is not caused by using an obsolete version of any file or
   of other software. 

 * You are using the original version of all files, not one that has
   been modified elsewhere.

If you think you have found a genuine bug in a recent version of the
Babel software please report it in the same way as bugs for LaTeX2e
are reported:

 * Generate a bug report template by running the file
   latexbug.tex through LaTeX2e.

 * Fill in the spaces in the generated template file.
 
 * Include all necessary information, especially a complete input
   file, a complete transcript file, and all other files used (if they
   are not standard).

   Please check carefully to ensure that any non-standard files are
   essential to the bug; and remember that I cannot debug files not
   supplied by me.

   Any such non-standard files should be included in a `filecontents'
   environment at the start of your input file.

 * Please note that it is important to make the input file as small
   as possible since this will enable me to find and fix the error
   quickly.  It also helps me because then I can often use it as test
   file for future releases.
   
   I would expect most files to be less than 60 lines, and very
   rarely to be longer than 100 lines.
   
   This can often be achieved by defining a command to be some
   arbitrary text and using this several times if it is necessary to
   generate longer bits of text.

Error reports concerning UNCHANGED versions of Babel files should be
sent by E-mail to:
