Why do I need this program?

  If you work with PasTeX and you don't have enough disk space,
  you might have only the pk-files you really need on your harddisk.

  Here helps this program, together with the MARK option of
  ShowDVI and DVIprint. Start ShowDVI and DVIprint always
  with the MARK option (put it into ENVARC:SHOWDVI and 
  ENVARC:DVIPRINT) and the drivers will mark every font they
  used with an use-count and a date-stamp.

  After some time, if you want get rid of old, seldom used fonts,
  start "lsfont TeX:pk TO ram:fontlist" and look into the generated
  list. The first number is the use count. So often is the font
  used from a driver (started with MARK).

  If you want delete some fonts of the list, do 
  "lsfont TeX:pk TO ram:fontlist DELETE" and edit the file (delete all
  fonts out of the file which you *don't* want delete from your
  harddisk). After that, you can "execute ram:fontlist" delete the
  old fonts.

  Other idea to use the list:
  Do copy the fonts first on some floppy-disks and delete them after
  that from the hard-disk. Now, if you put your backup floppies into
  TeX:config/FontVols, the drivers will find them on your floppies.
