Short: New version of flib (for PasTeX1.3)

New fatures:

- wildcard support (only if compiled with DICE)
- strip path/extension if adding a font to a library

Example:

  % flib avse TeX:fontlib/PK0100 TeX:pk/100/#?

This will add all fonts of TeX:pk/100 into the fontlib
TeX:fontlib/PK0100 and strip the path "TeX:pk/100/"
as well as the extension ".100pk" from the module
names. So ShowDVI/DVIprint will find the fonts
immediately without changing anything in TeX:config/#?.fnt.

Note: Wildcard support is only for adding modules,
not for extracting them! (No matching within the library)
