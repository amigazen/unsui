Directions for installing this Amiga TeX Kit:

1. Read the file README thoroughly


2. Ensure this directory is assigned as TeX:, e.g. by placing

   assign TeX: <this directory> 

in the file s:User-Startup (AmigaDOS 2.0 and above) or the file
s:Startup-Sequence (AmigaDOS 1.3). If you do not have a hard disk you
will need to spread the directories across several floppies; put one
or two on each disk and set the environment variables accordingly (see
the README file, e.g.:

   setenv TEXINPUTS ,TeXDisk1:inputs

or with AmigaDOS 2.0 and above, use a multi-assign:

   assign TeX: TeXDisk1:
   assign TeX: add TeXDisk2: 
   (etc.)


3. Make sure TeX:exe is on your path, e.g. with the command

   path add TeX:exe

in your startup.


4. You will now need to build format files. This is done with initex,
which needs a larger pool memory size than virtex. Change the value
for "poolsize" in TeX:config/texmemory.config to about 60000, and the
value of "maxstrings" to about 6000. Use the following command
sequences to build TeX and LaTeX respectively:

For TeX:

   initex
   This is TeX, C version 3.141 (INITEX)
   **\input plain
   **\dump
   ...
   rename plain.fmt TeX:formats/plain.fmt

For LaTeX:

   initex
   This is TeX, C version 3.141 (INITEX)
   **\lefthyphenmin=2
   **\righthyphenmin=3
   **\input lplain
   **\dump
   ...
   rename lplain.fmt TeX:formats/lplain.fmt


5. Define aliases to use them, e.g.

   alias latex "virtex &lplain "
   alias tex "virtex &plain "

or if you only intend to use one of them,

   rename TeX:exe/virtex TeX:exe/latex
   rename TeX:formats/lplain.fmt TeX:formats/latex.fmt

(virtex always looks for a .fmt file of the same name)
