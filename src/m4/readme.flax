This is the port of M4 macro package to the amiga.
I just compiled the PD package and added some functions, also
claned up some code that wouldn't work on the amiga.
I haven't done too extensive tests, but it works fine with
the included testfiles. Anyway, if you find a bug, you have the 
source, so diffs will be enough.
The source included here compiles with just a few warnings
