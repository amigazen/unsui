tested.
 
NOTES:
   I undid the shar to undo the uuencoded compressed files, and to separate
the docs from everything else.
   I nroffed the docs so everybody gets a readable copy of the docs.
   A patch to some of the test files was included with the origional posting..
I applied the patch to the files and excluded the patch from this posting.
