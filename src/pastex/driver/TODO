What is still missing in ShowDVI and DVIprint?
==============================================


Both programs:
--------------

 * Virtual font support. 
   Virtual fonts are not so complicicated, but to implement them
   in my drivers, there are some bigger changes in util/new_font.?
   necessary. :-(

 * New documentation!


ShowDVI:
--------

 * New menu layout.
 * Preference window to setup all config values of the SHowDVI.config file.
 * Online-Help. It's mostly finished, but the help file (config/ShowDVI.guide)
   is only experimental.
 * Antialiasing/gray support like xdvi (?).


DVIprint:
---------

 * Finish the MUI GUI. To setup all (nearly) CLI switches.
 * Support for more printers (font downloading?).


And more....?
