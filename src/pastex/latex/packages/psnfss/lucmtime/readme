Lucida Math symbols mixed with fake Times Math.

This is a variant on Alan Jeffrey's mathptm; it takes all the
letters and numbers from Monotype Times Italic (and bold Italic) and builds
up the rest of the `letters' math font with Lucida New Math Italic;
this is for both normal and bold. The symbols and extension font are
pure Lucida. The Lucida is scaled to .9 of the design size, which is
a guess. Result is Times-like math, but with a full symbol set.
