A set of LaTeX2e package files to load the common PostScript fonts,
together with a special package for Lucida fonts. This corresponds
to the description in the LaTeX Companion, p. 334. The collection is
useless without the font description (fd) and font metric files for
the font families you wish to use. These can be obtained from the CTAN
archives or your TeX supplier. On CTAN they are in fonts/psfonts,
divided up by foundry (adobe, monotype etc), and then by 8 character
family name. Each directory has sets of .vf, .tfm, and .fd files which
you have to install where TeX will read them. It also has a .map file
suitable for appending to the psfonts.map file of dvips.

A more detailed description can be obtained by processing psnfss2e.tex.

See lucida.txt to see how the  Lucida Bright fonts and their
names are used, relative to the names which Y&Y supply them in.
