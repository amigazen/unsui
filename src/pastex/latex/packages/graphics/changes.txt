          colour commands. Conversion from `user syntax' to `special

          that I must have added while asleep:-) Now the earlier correct
          settings actually take effect.

        * graphics.dtx: Changed the handling of `missing file' errors. 
          If no extension is supplied, each extension in the list is tried
          until a file is found. A File not found error is generated if
          this search fails.
          If an extension is supplied, only a warning is given if the file
          does not exist. This allows the file to be created `on the fly'
          eg by extracting the file from a tar or zip archive.

Fri Apr 29 19:36:30 1994  David Carlisle  (carlisle@r8d)

          so that definitions in the .def file are not zapped.

Mon Apr 18 10:56:55 1994  David Carlisle  (carlisle@r8d)

        * color.dtx: Stop \normalfont resetting the colour. (\reset@font
          does still reset the colour. This allows \rm to work as
          expected. 
          Fix marginpar, so the baseline is correctly aligned.

        * \rotatebox* removed
    
        * The order of the arguments of \includegraphics corrected
    
        * \includegraphics[lower-l,lower-r][upper-l,upper-r]{file}
    
        * \definecolor not \newcolor to define colours
