	* stdh.h:  make sure FD_CLEXEC is defined if we support F_SETFD.
	
	* emacs.c: Attempt to make alloc() of x_tab acceptible to more
	compilers.  Not 100% yet.

	* Improved fd_clexec handling for systems that don't have
	an F_SETFD fcntl().  The new arrangement will not blow up if an
	attempt is made to fd_clexec a fd above MAXFD (64 by default).
	main.c:main()  and io.c:savefd() now simply call
	exec.c:fd_clexec().

	* Since many people had problems using the headers and libraries
	in std/*, modified sh/* so that they can be compiled in the
	absence of std/*.  This requires putting in some fixes that I had
	left out from my 3.2 version.  Particularly, catering for systems
	that do not have F_SETFD.

	* exec.c:
	Added fd_clexec array for tracking fd's to close in child after
	fork().  This is avoid wasting fd's on systems that don't have
	F_SETFD.

	* jobs.c:
	Allow Sun's and perhaps other BSD systems to define WAIT_T to be
	union wait and thus use their native status handling for children.

	* The file sh/MACHINES now tracks systems the shell has been
	compiled on.

	* Updated MACHINES.
	* Placed source under CVS.  This should help with processing fixes
	from the field.

	* Getting ready for 4.3 release.

	* Cleaned up the build process slightly.  Makefiles in ./std tree
	now maintain objects within the libraries rather than simply
	building the .o's and archiving them.  Of course the make(1) used
	must know how to maintain libraries :-)

	* Added bug.report as a template for bug reporting.

	* Source in ./sh can be built independently of ./std tree if
	desired.  See comments in ./sh/Makefile.

	* As originally distributed some of libstdc.a was not used and
	libposix.a was not used at all.  On Sun's this highlighted a bug
	(incompatibility) in the times() call.  Now the ./std/libs are
	used fully, and the supplied times() call functions as expected.
