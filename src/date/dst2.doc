      Program:  dst2
   Programmer:  George Kerber
      Written:  01/01/90
      Purpose:  Automatically adjust the Amiga system clock for 
                Daylight Savings Time


    Directions:  1.  Copy 'dst2' to your c: directory.
                 2.  Always keep your battery backup clock set for
                     STANDARD time in your area.
                 3.  Add 'dst2' to your startup-sequence after any command
                     necessary to read your battery backup clock.


                 
    Then whenever you boot up your Amiga, DST2 will check if it's daylight
    savings time for the current year.  If daylight savings time is in
    effect, DST2 will increment your system clock by 1 hour.  Since this
    will not change your battery backup clock, the test will be valid
    every time you boot up.

    Only run DST2 once per login session, or the clock may get incremented
    more than once.



    NOTE:  I released a version of DST a while ago that was much larger and
           did more things.  All versions have the same functions, but this
           version (2.0) will not automatically set the env variable 
           TIMEZONE for use with the old udate program.  The TIMEZONE
           env variable that was set with the old DST program is not
           compatible with the newest udate program anyway.

           If you are using the latest version (1.15c) of 'udate' that I 
           wrote the 'dst' functions are included in 'udate'.  So there is
           no reason to use 'dst'.  I simply wrote a stand alone version
           of 'dst' to accomodate the people who wanted the 'dst' functions
           in a smaller package that the entire 'udate' program.
