DST2(1)                    General Commands Manual                   DST2(1)

NAME
     dst2 – automatically adjust the Amiga system clock for Daylight Saving Time

SYNOPSIS
     dst2

DESCRIPTION
     The dst2 utility automatically adjusts the Amiga system clock for
     Daylight Saving Time (DST).  This is a standalone version of the DST
     functionality that is also integrated into the main date command.

     The utility checks if daylight saving time is in effect for the current
     year and automatically increments the system clock by 1 hour if
     necessary.  Since this only affects the system clock and not the
     battery backup clock, the test remains valid across reboots.

     The dst2 utility should only be executed once per login session to
     prevent multiple clock adjustments.

INSTALLATION
     Copy the dst2 program to your c: directory:

           1> copy dst2 c:

     Always keep your battery backup clock set for STANDARD time in your
     area.  Add 'dst2' to your startup-sequence after any command necessary
     to read your battery backup clock.

USAGE
     Simply execute dst2 without any arguments:

           1> dst2

     The utility will automatically check if DST is in effect and adjust
     the system clock accordingly.

STARTUP SEQUENCE
     Add this line to your startup-sequence after any commands necessary
     to read your battery backup clock:

           1> dst2

     Set your battery clock to standard time in your area and add the above
     line to your startup-sequence file.  If a command is necessary in the
     startup-sequence to read the battery clock, the 'dst2' line must
     follow the readclock command.

     The 'dst2' command should only be executed once per login session.
     If setup properly, you will NEVER have to do the twice yearly ritual
     of resetting your computer clock for daylight savings time.

INTEGRATION WITH DATE COMMAND
     The dst2 utility provides the same functionality as the -d option
     in the main date command.  If you are using the enhanced date command
     (version 2.0 or later), you can use either:

     • Standalone: dst2
     • Integrated: date -d

     Both methods provide identical DST adjustment functionality.

EXIT STATUS
     The dst2 utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Manual DST adjustment:
           $ dst2
           [System clock adjusted for DST if necessary]

     Add to startup-sequence:
           ; Add after readclock command
           dst2

STANDARDS
     This utility is Amiga-specific and does not conform to any POSIX
     standard.  It provides Amiga-specific DST functionality.

HISTORY
     The dst2 utility was originally written by George Kerber as a
     standalone version of the DST functionality integrated into the
     udate command.  This version has been updated for compatibility
     with the modern POSIX-compliant date command.

BUGS
     The dst2 utility should only be executed once per login session.
     Multiple executions may result in incorrect clock adjustments.

     The utility does not provide any visual feedback when adjusting
     the clock.  Check the system time after execution to verify
     the adjustment.
