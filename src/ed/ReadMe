Software Tools ed.

This editor is based in the editor described in the original
Software Tools book.  The code for pattern matching/regular
expressions is based on code printed in Dr. Dobbs Journal
"running light with-out overbyte".

This editor is very similar to the UNIX "ed" editor but not
identical.
