Subject: GNU Emacs 18.59, Amiga RELEASE 1.29, available for download

[Note: This is *NOT* emacs 19, but a last version of emacs 18. See 
explanation below]

Emacs is a very powerful, but sometimes cryptic, text editor. Its basic
features are similar to those of the MEmacs editor which comes with 
AmigaDOS (in the Tools directory), but has numerous other facilities:
- unlimited undo.
- language specific editing, with automatic (re)indentation.
- a dialect of lisp as extension language, leading to extreme 
  reconfigurability.
- abbreviations for commonly typed words.
- complete on-line manual.
- powerful search & replace facilities (including wildcards).

In this Amiga version, I have tried to make it easier to use with menus, 
mouse, clipboard, rexx and workbench support.

This version (1.29) tracks the update from GNU Emacs 18.58 to 18.59. It
is very close to the version on the FreshFish CD ROM, with a few bug
fixes (and hopefully no problems).

This is the last release that I will make. Porting of emacs 19 is
being corrdinated by David Gilbert (dgilbert@gamiga.guelphnet.dweomer.org or
dgilbert@snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca), please send any queries to him.

System requirements:
- AmigaDOS 2.04
- At least 2MB of memory (emacs uses about 750k + memory for the files
  being edited).
- 2.5MB of free disk space for the binary version, 8MB for the 
  source version (but you can remove some of the files once it has been
  installed).
- Emacs works with a 68000 (A500,A2000), but is a bit slow. It is very
  pleasant to use with a 68030/25MHz ...

The following distributions are available:

o binary only:
  All the files necessary to use emacs. Has only a subset of the lisp files,
  the rest may be got from a standard emacs distribution.
  Distribution: ftp:
    site: litamiga.epfl.ch (x.x.x.x) and other aminet sites
    file: amiga/util/gnu/a1.29-emacs-18.59-bin.LHA

o full amiga version:
  All the files necessary to compile emacs, all the lisp files, etc.
  Some of the source files of the Unix or VMS versions are not included.
  This source is written for SAS C 6.2
  Distribution: ftp:
    site: litamiga.epfl.ch (x.x.x.x) and other aminet sites
    file: amiga/util/gnu/a1.29-emacs-18.59-src.LHA


This port was originally based on that of Mark Henning (gnuemacs
v1.10), but after having made rather extensive modifications, added
numerous features and updated it to Emacs 18.59, I decided to
release it myself.
