To compile emacs, you will need SAS C 6.01 or later. If you try to
make it work with Aztec C or gcc, you might run into difficulties with
the dumping code: 
- The "small" data model (A4-relative) is used, to get all the variables
  in one hunk.
- Some variables are declared with the "far" attribute to get them out
  of this hunk (and the dumping code depends on this). Move these to
  the amiga_data.c module (which is for variables that shouldn't be
  dumped).

To compile:

a) Install my 'unix compatibility' library (available by ftp and on fish
   disks).

b) Install as usual (see INSTALLATION).

c) Compile the C preprocessor (SAS's one has a few problems ...):

     cd gnuemacs:cpp
     smake

d) Compile & dump emacs

     stack 20000
     cd gnuemacs:src
     smake
     copy temacs /

   (This takes around 20 minutes from scratch on an A2500/30).

If all goes well, you should have a new version of emacs ...
