This is a minor update to the version of less released on disk number 74.
It is primarily of interest to users that have only a single disk drive
and who do not have some other program that calls the Manx getenv() library
call.  This version does not use getenv() and thus eliminates the annoying 
disk requestor that would come up everytime it was run without having
the workbench disk available.
