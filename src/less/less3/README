This is an updated version of "LESS" from Fish #34

It fixes several bugs and has some nice new features

* It is a "better more" , that is you can go forward or backward, search,
    got to line numbers, or a percentage of the file, <space> moves forward
    just like more, however "b" backs up and many more options are available
    (type h for help)

* It now works from the WorkBench and can show files with blanks in the names

* Templates now work -- yes you can say: less *.c *.h "Amiga File Name"
     and browse through 100 files in one command

* Backspace and ^X now work in searches

[Ed note:  As received, less defaulted to having the command line option
 -p active (which presented the next screen by clearing the current one
 and repainting from the top).  However, I found this visually confusing
 and opposite the default behavior of less on other systems.  I believe
 Bob set it up this way because it was faster.  I hope he doesn't mind
 that I changed it back.  If you prefer the -p default, the original
 version is "less.orig".  -Fred Fish, 2-May-87]
