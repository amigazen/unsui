          _L_e_s_s is a program similar to _m_o_r_e(1), but which allows
          backwards movement in the file as well as forward movement.
          Also, _l_e_s_s does not have to read the entire input file
          before starting, so with large input files it starts up
          faster than text editors like _v_i(1).  _L_e_s_s uses termcap, so
          it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited
          support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal,
          lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are
          prefixed with an up-arrow.)

          Commands are based on both _m_o_r_e and _v_i.  Commands may be
          preceeded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions
          below.  The number is used by some commands, as indicated.

          SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE
               Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option
               ----zzzz below).  If N is more than the screen size, only one
               screenful is displayed.

          ffff    Same as SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE.

          bbbb    Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option
               ----zzzz below).  If N is more than the screen size, only one
               screenful is displayed.

          dddd    Scroll forward N lines, default 10.  If N is specified,
               it becomes the new default for all dddd and uuuu commands.

          rrrr    Repaint the screen.

          RRRR    Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.
               Useful if the file is changing while it is being
               viewed.

          gggg    Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of
               file).  (Warning: this may be slow if N is large.)

          GGGG    Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
               (Warning: this may be slow if standard input, rather
               than a file, is being read.)

          pppp    Go to a position N percent into the file.  N should be
               between 0 and 100.  (This is possible if standard input
               is being read, but only if _l_e_s_s has already read to the
               end of the file.  It is always fast, but not always
               useful.)

          ''''_l   Followed by any lowercase letter, _l, returns to the
               position which was previously marked with that letter.
               All marks are lost when a new file is examined.

          ////ppppaaaatttttttteeeerrrrnnnn
               Search forward in the file for the N-th occurence of
               the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  N defaults to 1.  The _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is a
               regular expression, as recognized by _e_d.  The search
               starts at the second line displayed (but see the ----tttt
               option, which changes this).

          ????ppppaaaatttttttteeeerrrrnnnn
               Search backward in the file for the N-th occurence of
               the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The search starts at the line immediately
               before the top line displayed.

          nnnn    Repeat previous search, for N-th occurence of the last
               _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

          EEEE [_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e]
               Examine a new file.  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is missing, the
               "current" file (see the NNNN and PPPP commands below) from
               the list of files in the command line is re-examined.

          NNNN    Examine the next file (from the list of files given in
               the command line).  If a number N is specified (not to
               be confused with the command NNNN), the N-th next file is
               examined.

          PPPP    Examine the previous file.  If a number N is specified,
               the N-th previous file is examined.

          ====    Prints the name of the file being viewed and the byte
               offset of the bottom line being displayed.  If
               possible, it also prints the length of the file and the
               percent of the file above the last displayed line.

          ----    Followed by one of the command line option letters (see
               below), this will toggle the setting of that option and
               print a message describing the new setting.

          VVVV    Prints the version number of _l_e_s_s being run.

          qqqq    Exits _l_e_s_s.

          The following two commands may or may not be valid,
          depending on your particular installation.

          vvvv    Invokes an editor to edit the current file being
               viewed.  The editor is taken from the environment
               variable EEEEDDDDIIIITTTTOOOORRRR, or defaults to _v_i.

          !!!! _s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               Invokes a shell to run the _s_h_e_l_l-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d given.

     OOOOPPPPTTTTIIIIOOOONNNNSSSS
          Command line options are described below.  Options are also
          taken from the environment variable LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS.  (The environment
          variable is parsed before the command line, so command line
          options override the LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS environment variable.  Options may
          be changed while _l_e_s_s is running via the """"----"""" command.)  For
          example, if you like more-style prompting, to avoid typing
          lllleeeessssssss ----mmmm ............ each time _l_e_s_s is invoked, you might tell _c_s_h:

          sssseeeetttteeeennnnvvvv LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS mmmm

          or if you use _s_h:

          LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS====mmmm;;;; eeeexxxxppppoooorrrrtttt LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS

          ----ssss   The ----ssss flag causes consecutive blank lines to be
               squeezed into a single blank line.  This is useful when
               viewing _n_r_o_f_f output.

          ----tttt   Normally, forward searches start just after the top
               displayed line (that is, at the second displayed line).



     Page 3                                           (printed 9/1/86)






     LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS((((llll))))                     UUUUNNNNIIIIXXXX 5555....0000                      LLLLEEEESSSSSSSS((((llll))))



               Thus forward searches include the currently displayed
               screen.  The ----tttt command line option causes forward
               searches to start just after the bottom line displayed,
               thus skipping the currently displayed screen.

          ----mmmm   Normally, _l_e_s_s prompts with a colon.  The ----mmmm command
               line option causes _l_e_s_s to prompt verbosely like _m_o_r_e,
               printing the file name and percent into the file.

          ----MMMM   The ----MMMM command line option causes _l_e_s_s to prompt even
               more verbosely than _m_o_r_e.

          ----qqqq   Normally, if an attempt is made to scroll past the end
               of the file or before the beginning of the file, the
               terminal bell is rung to indicate this fact.  The ----qqqq
               command line option tells _l_e_s_s not to ring the bell at
               such times.  If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is
               used instead.

          ----QQQQ   Even if ----qqqq is given, _l_e_s_s will ring the bell on certain
               other errors, such as typing an invalid character.  The
               ----QQQQ command line option tells _l_e_s_s to be quiet all the
               time; that is, never ring the terminal bell.  If the
               terminal has a "visual bell", it is used instead.

          ----eeee   Normally the only way to exit less is via the "q"
               command.  The ----eeee command line option tells less to
               automatically exit the second time it reaches end-of-
               file.

          ----uuuu   If the ----uuuu command line option is given, backspaces are
               treated as printable characters; that is, they are sent
               to the terminal when they appear in the input.

          ----UUUU   If the ----UUUU command line option is given, backspaces are
               printed as the two character sequence "^H".  If neither
               ----uuuu nor ----UUUU is given, backspaces which appear adjacent to
               an underscore character or sequences of a character
               interleaved with backspaces are treated specially:  the
               underlined or boldfaced text is displayed using the
               terminal's hardware capability.  Note that the ----vvvv
               option below superceeds both ----uuuu and ----UUUU.

          ----wwww   Normally, _l_e_s_s uses a tilde character to represent
               lines past the end of the file.  The ----wwww option causes
               blank lines to be used instead.

          ----dddd   Normally, _l_e_s_s will complain if the terminal is dumb;
               that is, lacks some important capability, such as the
               ability to clear the screen or scroll backwards.  The
               ----dddd flag suppresses this complaint (but does not
               otherwise change the behavior of the program on a dumb

               terminal).

          ----pppp   Normally, _l_e_s_s will repaint the screen by scrolling
               from the bottom of the screen.  If the ----pppp flag is set,
               when _l_e_s_s needs to change the entire display, it will
               clear the screen and paint from the top line down.

          ----hhhh_n  Normally, _l_e_s_s will scroll backwards when backwards
               movement is necessary.  The ----hhhh option specifies a
               maximum number of lines to scroll backwards.  If it is
               necessary to move backwards more than this many lines,
               the screen is repainted in a forward direction.  (If
               the terminal does not have the ability to scroll
               backwards, ----hhhh_0 is implied.)

          ----[[[[zzzz]]]]_n
               When given a backwards or forwards window command, _l_e_s_s
               will by default scroll backwards or forwards one
               screenful of lines.  The ----zzzz option changes the default
               scrolling window size to _n lines.  If _n is greater than
               the screen size, the scrolling window size will be set
               to one screenful.  Note that the zzzz is optional for
               compatibility with more.

          ----xxxx   The ----xxxx command line option sets tab stops every _n
               positions.  The default for _n is 8.

          ----bbbb[[[[ffffpppp]]]]_n
               The ----bbbb command line option tells _l_e_s_s to use a non-
               standard buffer size.  There are two standard (default)
               buffer sizes, one is used when a file is being read and
               the other when a pipe (standard input) is being read.
               The current defaults are 5 buffers for files and 12 for
               pipes.  (Buffers are 1024 bytes.)  The number _n
               specifies a different number of buffers to use.  The ----bbbb
               may be followed by ffff, in which case only the file
               default is changed, or by pppp in which case only the pipe
               default is changed.  Otherwise, both are changed.

          ----cccc   Normally, when data is read by _l_e_s_s, it is scanned to
               ensure that bit 7 (the high order bit) is turned off in
               each byte read, and to ensure that there are no null
               (zero) bytes in the data (null bytes are turned into
               "@" characters).  If the data is known to be "clean",
               the ----cccc command line option will tell _l_e_s_s to skip this
               checking, causing an imperceptible speed improvement.
               (However, if the data is not "clean", unpredicatable
               results may occur.)

          ----vvvv   The ----vvvv option tells less to print non-printing
               characters in a visible way ala _c_a_t(1).  Control
               characters are printed as ^X (the delete character

               (octal 0177) is printed as ^?).  Characters with the
               0200 bit set are printed as M- followed by the
               character represented by the low order seven bits.

          ++++_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
               If a command line option begins with ++++, the remainder
               of that option is taken to be an initial command to
               _l_e_s_s.  For example, ++++_G tells _l_e_s_s to start at the end
               of the file rather than the beginning, and ++++/_x_y_z tells
               it to start at the first occurence of _x_y_z in the file.
               As a special case, ++++<_n_u_m_b_e_r> acts like ++++<_n_u_m_b_e_r>_g; that
               is, it starts the display at the specified line number
               (however, see the caveat under the gggg command above).
               If the option starts with ++++++++, the initial command
               applies to every file being viewed, not just the first
               one.

          When used on standard input (rather than a file), you can
          move backwards only a finite amount, corresponding to that
          portion of the file which is still buffered.
