Less Version 1.6Z, the first major release after version 1.4Z, includes
several small bug fixes, code optimizations, enhancements, and the
changes necessary to allow compilation under SAS/C v. 6.3.

A major change is that the Amiga console IO routines have been completely
rewritten to permit optional use of the original CLI window or even an
AUX: console, using -[cli] on the command line or in the LESS environment
string (e.g. to get this effect, you would type something like
"Less -[cli] myfile.txt" at the CLI prompt).

I also added a 'w' code to the window designator, to cause the Less
window to be built relative to the CLI window from which it was launched.
This permits the user to specify, for instance, that Less is to open its
window the same size as the existing cli window, but offset slightly to
the lower right (-[w+10,w+12,w,w] on the command line or in the LESS
environment string).  Note that with offsets -[w,w,w,w] the Less window
will _appear_ to open in the original CLI window, but your old window
and contents will appear to be restored when Less exits.

Minor changes:  By default, Less no longer displays ^M at the end of
lines of MS-DOS files.  The old behavior of showing all control characters
can be re-instated using the -f switch. The AmigaDos version command
can now read version information from the Less binary.  Less 1.4Z had a
bug dealing with one ANSI mode command that has now been fixed (<CSI>m,
with no intervening number).

Thanks to the new code optimization provided by SAS/C 6.3, and a few
recoded routines in Less itself, this upgraded functionality comes with
an actually *reduced* program size!  When's the last time you saw a
program upgrade that did that?
