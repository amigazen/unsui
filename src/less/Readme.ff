Less
A text file reader, descended from Unix "Less."  This
version adds an option to suppress opening a new window,
using the existing CLI window instead (especially
useful with an AUX: shell), and includes some minor bug
fixes.  This is version 1.6Z, an update to version 1.4Z
on disk 511.  Includes source in SAS C 6.3.
