.SH NAME
f77 - Fortran compiler.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B f77
[options] file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B f77
is an AmigaDOS frontend for the port of the AT&T Laboratories and
Bellcore
.B f2c
Fortran to C translator that works with the SAS AmigaDOS C compiler
version 6.51. It tries to give the impression of a true Fortran
compiler for AmigaDOS. The frontend accepts the following types of
file arguments:
.PP
Arguments that end with .f are compiled as Fortran 77 source files.
If each source compiles successfully, its corresponding object file is
left in the current directory in a file whose name is that of the
source, with .o substituted for .f.
.PP
Arguments that end with .c are assumed to be C source files, and are
compiled, producing .o files.
.PP
Arguments that end with .o are passed on to the linker (see
the SAS documentation for slink) to be linked into the final program.
.PP
Arguments that end with .lib are taken to be standard AmigaDOS linker
libraries of .o files to be searched in the order they appear.
.PP
f77 accepts the following options:
.TP
+B
Treat the backslash character as a C-like escape character.
.TP
-C
Enable array subscript range checking.
.TP
-c
Suppress linking and produce an object (.o) file from each source file.
.TP
-g
Generate information needed by the symbolic SAS CodeProbe debugger.
.TP
-I2
Make default size of integers and logicals INTEGER*2 and LOGICAL*2.
.TP
-I4
Make default size of integers and logicals INTEGER*4 and LOGICAL*4.
.TP
.RI -l " name"
Search the library lib:name.lib. Libraries specified by this option
is searched after the ones given directly.
.TP
-noext
Do not accept any extensions to Fortran 77, like DO - END DO.
.TP
-O
Enable the SAS C global optimizer.
.TP
.RI -o " outfile"
Name the output file resulting from linking
.I outfile
instead of the default file name a.out.
.TP
-onetrip
Execute any DO loop at least once.
.TP
-S
Translate the named Fortran source files and leave the C language
output in corresponding files whose names are suffixed with .c
(no .o files are created). 
.TP
+U
Distinguish uppercase and lowercase (make case significant).
Keywords must be lowercase.
.TP
-u
Force types of identifiers to be implicitly undeclared (same as
specifying IMPLICIT NONE).
.TP
-v
Enable the verbose mode, producing a step-by-step
description of the compilation process. This may generate a lot
of noise.
.TP
-w
Suppress all warning messages from
.B f2c .
.TP
-w66
Enable warnings about Fortran 66 features used.
