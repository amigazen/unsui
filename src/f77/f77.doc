       ff7777 is an AmigaDOS frontend for the port of the AT&T Labo�
       ratories and Bellcore ff22cc Fortran  to  C  translator  that
       works  with  the  SAS AmigaDOS C compiler version 6.51. It
       tries to give the impression of a  true  Fortran  compiler
       for  AmigaDOS. The frontend accepts the following types of
       file arguments:

       Arguments that end with .f  are  compiled  as  Fortran  77
       source  files.   If each source compiles successfully, its
       corresponding object file is left in the current directory
       in  a  file whose name is that of the source, with .o sub�
       stituted for .f.

       Arguments that end with .c are  assumed  to  be  C  source
       files, and are compiled, producing .o files.

       Arguments  that  end  with  .o are passed on to the linker
       (see the SAS documentation for slink) to  be  linked  into
       the final program.

       Arguments that end with .lib are taken to be standard Ami�
       gaDOS linker libraries of .o files to be searched  in  the
       order they appear.

       f77 accepts the following options:

       +B     Treat  the  backslash  character as a C-like escape
              character.

       -C     Enable array subscript range checking.

       -c     Suppress linking and produce an  object  (.o)  file
              from each source file.

       -g     Generate  information  needed  by  the symbolic SAS
              CodeProbe debugger.

       -I2    Make default size of integers  and  logicals  INTE�
              GER*2 and LOGICAL*2.

       -I4    Make  default  size  of integers and logicals INTE�
              GER*4 and LOGICAL*4.

       -l _n_a_m_e
              Search the library lib:name.lib.  Libraries  speci�
              fied  by  this  option  is  searched after the ones
              given directly.

       -noext Do not accept any extensions to Fortran 77, like DO
              - END DO.

       -O     Enable the SAS C global optimizer.

       -o _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
              Name the output file resulting from linking _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
              instead of the default file name a.out.

       -onetrip
              Execute any DO loop at least once.

       -S     Translate the named Fortran source files and  leave
              the  C language output in corresponding files whose
              names are suffixed with .c (no .o  files  are  cre�
              ated).

       +U     Distinguish uppercase and lowercase (make case sig�
              nificant).  Keywords must be lowercase.

       -u     Force types of identifiers to be  implicitly  unde�
              clared (same as specifying IMPLICIT NONE).

       -v     Enable  the  verbose mode, producing a step-by-step
              description of the compilation  process.  This  may
              generate a lot of noise.

       -w     Suppress all warning messages from ff22cc ..

       -w66   Enable warnings about Fortran 66 features used.
