Short: du (disk-usage) for 2.04 only (PD, with source)

YAND? Yet another new 'du'?

Yes I know, there are much other 'du' programs available
(`which du all` founds 5 'du's on my disk).
But I like none of these really.
Some of them does have strange output, or no wildcard
support, or a strange block count, or ...

Ok, but why my new 'du' ?

- output is like the output from the UNIX du
- SHORT and ALL options like the UNIX du
- wildcard support
- count of the blocks is the same of c:list (with FFS)
- supports different block sizes
- output in bytes or kB instead of blocks
- don't show .info files if NOINFO is active
- program is pure (can be made resident)

This all in 2616 bytes (the second smalles of my du-collection).

Program and source are public domain.
If you improve the program, please send me a copy.

You like/need it?  :-)
