DU(1)                    USER COMMANDS                      DU(1)


NAME
     du - display the number of disk blocks used per directory or
     file

SYNOPSIS
     du DIR/M,BYTE/S,KBYTE/S,ALL/S,SHORT/S,NOINFO/S

DESCRIPTION
     du  gives  the  number of blocks contained in all files and,
     recursively,  directories within each specified directory or
     file DIR.  If DIR is missing `""' (the current directory) is
     used).

OPTIONS
     BYTE   Display number of used bytes instead of blocks.
     KBYTE  Display number of used kB instead of blocks.
     ALL    Generate an entry for each file.
     SHORT  Only display the grand total for each of the 
            specified DIR's.
     NOINFO Don't show .info files.
     Entries are generated only for each directory in the absence
     of options.

NOTE
     <number of blocks> != <bytes> / <blocksize>
     The  byte  count  is  only the sum of the size of all files.
     The  block count contains also the directory and file header
     blocks.   So  the  block  count  is more meaningfull for the
     state of a disk.

EXAMPLE
     % cd ram:
     % list all
     ENV                          Dir ----rwed Today     16:09:32
     Clipboards                   Dir ----rwed Today     16:09:30
     T                            Dir ----rwed Today     17:11:21
     3 directories - 6 blocks used

REQUIREMENTS

BUGS
     The  number  of  blocks,  reported by du is exactly the same
     like the from c:list (at FFS), but it's not the fully truth.
     du  doesn't count the file extension blocks, used by greater
     files.

MORE BUGS
     Probably.
