Summary: A replacement for STATUS 
 
I have been trying to figure out some of the dark, hidden secrets of AmigaDOS 
and my poking around has lead to the following program to replace STATUS. 
I like it because it tells me a lot more than STATUS.

STAT is a replacement for the AmigaDOS command STATUS.  It is far more
informative about the processes then the current command.  For each AmigaDOS
process, it prints the Task number, Priority, the Address of the process in
memory, the Command line being executed, and the current Directory.

Below is an example:

1> run stat > ram:d
Task Pri  Address Command                         Directory
  1    0     97b0 run stat > ram:d                 df1:stat
  2   -5    1af88 stat                             df1:stat

Good luck, and send me a message if you find any bugs.

I  use this program since I'm working on the Amiga (around 1987) and I'm very
used  to its output.  But since I upgraded to AmigaOS 2.0 and beyond, I found
it very annoying, that the program is not able to show me CLI's beyond 20.

It  also  sometimes  messes  up  the  Args  display,  because James used some
undocumented 'magic', which worked under AmigaOS 1.2 / 1.3 but not under 2.04
and beyond.  It will fail with an error message under AmigaOS 1.2 and 1.3.

This program was compiled using the wonderful SAS C 6.2 compiler.

This program is free for any non-commercial use and freely distributeable.

If you want to include it in a PD library, it is necessary to get permission
from the author.

        This permission is herewith given for the Fred Fish Library.
