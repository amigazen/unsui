DON'T FORGET: This version of Emacs REQUIRES AMIGADOS V2.04 !!

If you are updating from a previous version, the following steps apply:
- You must redefine your GNUEMACS: assign (the name of the directory
  has changed from emacs-18.58 to emacs-18.59).
- You should make sure you are using the lisp files (*.el and *.elc) which
  come with this release, as several of them have changed.

New users should do the following (assuming you are in the emacs-18.59
directory):

1. Copy amiga/.emacs, amiga/.emacs-menu.menu, amiga/.emacs-menu.el to s:
2. Copy amiga/c/#? to somewhere in your path.
3. Add an assign GNUEMACS: <wherever you've put the emacs directory> to 
   your User-Startup.
4. Install Matt Dillon's fifo.library and fifo: handler if you want to use
   external processes (This can be found on Fish disks). If you have any
   problems, try a version at least as recent as that on Fish Disk 588.
5. Define various environment variables (these all have defaults, so this
   isn't absolutely necessary, except for ESHELL) :

     USER     - a username (a la Unix) (default "user")
     USERNAME - your full name (default same as $USER)
     HOME     - your "home" directory (This is the directory refered to
		by ~/<file>, and where the .emacs file is looked for)
		(default "s:").
     HOSTNAME - a name for your system (default "amiga")
     ESHELL   - where to find an unix-like shell (no default). By unix-like
		I mean that it should not open a window to get its input.
		The only tested value for this is GNUEMACS:etc/sh.

   For instance, I have the following values:
     USER: dgay, USERNAME: David E. Gay, HOSTNAME: owl,
     ESHELL: gnuemacs:etc/sh

6. If you want to check that emacs is working, type 
 
  assign gnuemacs: ""
  emacs

   If all goes well, emacs should open a window. If you get
     memacs: Unknown command
   you have an alias for emacs. Try editing s:Shell-Startup and removing it.

   If you get
     emacs: file is not executable
   try typing
     protect <wherever you put the commands from step 2>/emacs +s

   And finally, if you get
     wrong number of arguments
     if failed returncode 10
   make sure that you have getstack in your path

7. If you are going to use emacs over a serial line, you must install 
   the termcap file, which comes with the source version. To do so, type:

     join gnuemacs:etc/termcap.ucb gnuemacs:etc/termcap.amiga as s:termcap
