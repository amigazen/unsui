Subject: Here's a couple of software for you

I was in need of fakemail and movemail, so I made them with some help of my
friend. Both of those programs are in GNUEmacs distibution, so I thought if
you'd like to include them.

They should be developed further, but they fill my needs.
If you make any changes to them, please send sources and binaries to me.

I suppose you know how the progs should work so I won't write any docs for
them.

I also have an AREXX version of inews made up. If you would like to have,
I could send to you. Maybe it should be in C, but REXX was enough for me.

BTW: Included is a emacs.rexx script I made to ease my life. It checks first
if the REXX-port exists and then starts emacs or just sends a rexx command
respectively.

distinews.lha contains directions for installing GNUS, the emacs news-reader,
and a replacement for the inews command.
