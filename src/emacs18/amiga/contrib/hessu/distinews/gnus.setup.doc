GNUS needs inews to post a news. I have made a rexx-script to over come this
problem, maybe I will do it in C later. I'll include this script.

Installation:

	1. Setup gnus straight from the gnus.tar.z. Don't make any changes
	   into the elisp code, all changes can be made in the .emacs file.

	2. Place the script in the directory you keep all your rexx-scripts.

	3. Add the following lines in your .emacs file.

		(setq gnus-startup-file "uulib:.newsrc")

		(setq gnus-nntp-service nil)
		(setq gnus-nntp-server "")
		(setq gnus-local-domain "your.domain")
		;;; Do not enter here your nodename, only domain!
		
		(setq gnus-organization-file "env:organization")
		(setq gnus-local-organization "Ferry Island Technologies")
		(setq news-inews-switches '("rexx:inews.rexx"))
		(setq news-inews-program "rx")
		(setq nnspool-inews-switches '("rexx:inews.rexx"))
		(setq nnspool-inews-program "rx")
		;;; Don't ask me why this is like this. But it works!

		(setq nnspool-active-file "uulib:active")
		(setq nnspool-history-file "uulib:history")

		(autoload 'gnus "gnus" "Read network news." t)
		(autoload 'gnus-post-news "gnuspost" "Post a news." t)

	4. Set an environment variable "organization"

	5. Place perg somewhere in your path.
	   Perg is like grep (search). But it takes from stdin and puts
	   to stdout. Here it is needed to stdin from gnus and stdout
	   to a temp file.

	6. You will also need fakeactive are similar. GNUS needs the active
	   file to find out what groups there are.

I am using a software made by Christian Wolf <chris@wolfhh.hanse.de>, to send
and recieve news. This software supports the active-file system and lots
more. It know what to do with control messages, like newgroup, rmgroup, etc.
