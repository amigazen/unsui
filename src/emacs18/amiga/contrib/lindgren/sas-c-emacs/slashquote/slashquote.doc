slashquote.library/SLASHQUOTE

   NAME
	SLASHQUOTE - Prefix special characters in a string.

   SYNOPSIS
	str = SLASHQUOTE(str)
		or
	str = SLASHQUOTE(str, char)

   FUNCTION
	Handles strings with should be sent through a parser by putting
	a special character before any occurances of that character and
	the double quote character. It then returns the string quoted.

	If no argument for the special character is given, backslash
	is used.

	The function was originally written for the program Mg3a, as
	a replace for a slow arexx macro by the same name. Mg3a uses
	the backslash and double-quote as special characters.
	It can also be used in command shells to fix arguments. Other
	uses can surely be found, like passing strings to GNUEmacs.
	
   EXAMPLE

	arg1		arg2		returned
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	hello		<none>		"hello"
	hel\lo		<none>		"hel\\lo"
	h"el\lo		<none>		"h\"el\\lo"
	h"el\lo		*		"h*"el\lo"
	h"el*lo		*		"h*"el**lo"
	"hi"		<none>		"\"hi\""
