		A simple Shell-dispatcher, which DOESN'T
			      open a window

				   and
			
		A emacs-filter which removes CTRL-O codes
		-----------------------------------------

	* Status
	~~~~~~~~

	This program is in the public domain.


	* Introduction
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	

	A while ago I recieved the GNU-EMACS V1.26 briliantly ported
	to the Amiga by David Gay. In this release asynchronous processes
	were supported for the first time. Normally a shell can be run
	in one of EMACS buffers, and a unix-sh-clone were supplied.

	I wanted to get my WShell running under EMACS, but
	the only way I know of starting WShell is by the command "NewWSH".
	Unfourtuantely It opens a window which isn't that useful under 
	these circumstances. What I wanted was a small command which 
	started a standard shell using the current input/outputstream, 
	a program which eventually became XSH.

	To use WShell the "SetExecute" from the WShell distribution
	must have been executed.

	
	* Install
	~~~~~~~~~

	To install XSH copy it to somewhere in your path.
	copy the file "sshell.el" to a place where EMACS can
	find it, for example "GnuEmacs:lisp".

	Insert the following line in your "s:.emacs"-file:

		(autoload 'sshell "sshell.el" nil t)

	* Note
	~~~~~~

	Some applications, like some versions of LS, tries to determine
	the width of the screen. If they don't handle a failure they
	will probably crash the machine. Commodores dir and list
	commands work allright though.


	* Usage
	~~~~~~~

	To start a wshell, type "M-x xshell". (For you not familar with
	EMACS syntax, press Escape, press "x", type "xshell" folloed
	by a return).

	A buffer, named *shell*, containing the shell will be opened.

	* Bugs/Todo etc.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	- xsh outputs two prompts in the beginning. It's only a cosmetic
	  problem so I haven't studied it at all.

	* History
