MKDIR(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir - create directories (POSIX compatible)
           - create whole path at once with Amiga native support

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
     
     # POSIX Style
     mkdir -p [-m mode] [-v] directory...
     
     # Amiga Style  
     mkdir DIRECTORY/M [PARENTS] [MODE/K] [VERBOSE] [ICON] [NOICON] [POSIX/K/F]

DESCRIPTION
     Create the specified directories. This hybrid implementation provides
     both POSIX compatibility and Amiga native functionality.
     
     The command automatically detects whether you're using POSIX-style
     arguments (starting with -) or Amiga-style arguments, and dispatches
     to the appropriate parser.
     
     By default, mkdir creates .info files for directories on Amiga,
     providing immediate Workbench icon display.

OPTIONS
     # POSIX Options
     -p, --parents     no error if existing, make parent directories as needed
     -m, --mode=MODE   set file permissions (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask
     -v, --verbose     print a message for each created directory
     -V, --version     output version information and exit
     -h, --help        display this help and exit
     
     # Amiga Options
     DIRECTORY/M       Directory name(s) to create (required)
     PARENTS           Create parent directories as needed
     MODE/K            Set directory permissions (mode string)
     VERBOSE           Print message for each created directory
     ICON              Force creation of .info files
     NOICON            Skip creation of .info files
     POSIX/K/F         POSIX escape hatch for mixed syntax

EXAMPLES
     # POSIX Style
     % mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/c
     % mkdir -m 755 dir1
     % mkdir -v dir1 dir2 dir3
     
     # Amiga Style
     % mkdir "ram:projects/src" PARENTS VERBOSE
     % mkdir "ram:temp" "ram:backup" "ram:archive"
     
     # Mixed Style (POSIX escape hatch)
     % mkdir DIRECTORY/M POSIX/K/F "-p -v /tmp/work/2025"
     
     # Interactive help
     % mkdir ?

DIAGNOSTICS
     missing operand: mkdir needs at least one directory to create.
     cannot create directory: permission denied or path invalid.
     warning: failed to create icon: directory created but icon failed.
     
     The command maintains POSIX exit codes:
     0 = success, 1 = failure

SEE ALSO
     makedir(1), list(1), touch(1), wc(1)

REQUIREMENTS
     An Amiga with OS version 2.04 or higher.
     Requires dos.library, icon.library, and workbench.library.

BUGS
     Mode setting (-m) is parsed but not yet implemented (Amiga limitation).
     Parent directory creation respects Amiga path syntax.
