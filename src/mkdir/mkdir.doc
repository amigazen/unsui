MKDIR(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir - create directories with icon
           - create whole path at once

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir NI=NOICON/S,NAME/M    (translated with -DDEFAULT_ICON)
      or
     mkdir ICON/S,NAME/M
    
DESCRIPTION
     Create   the  specified  directories.   If  the  program  is
     translated  with  -DDEFAULT_ICON,  mkdir create a .info file
     for  every directory, exept NOICON is given.  If the program
     is  translated  without -DDEFAULT_ICON, .info files are only
     created, if ICON is given.
     If   you  specify  a  path,  containing  some  not  existing
     directories, mkdir will create all missing ones.

OPTIONS
     NOICON   Don't  create .info files.  You can use this option 
              only if mkdir is translated with -DDEFAULT_ICON.
     ICON     Create .info files. Only available, if NOICON isn't
              available.

EXAMPLE
     % list
     Directory "" is empty
     % mkdir dir1/dir2 dir3
     % list
     dir3.info                    628 ----rw-d Today     16:58:01
     dir3                         Dir ----rwed Today     16:58:01
     dir1.info                    628 ----rw-d Today     16:58:01
     dir1                         Dir ----rwed Today     16:58:01
     2 files - 2 directories - 8 blocks used
     % list dir1

DIAGNOSTICS
     No name given: mkdir needs at least one directory to create.
     *** break: You have pressed Ctrl-C, havn't you? :-)
     xxx already exists:  directory  or file with name  xxx  does
          already exist.
     Can't create directory:  some  mystic things  prevent  mkdir
          from creating the directory. 
     Can't create icon xxx.info:  the directory xxx  is  created, 
          but mkdir has problems with creating the icon file.
