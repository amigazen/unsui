time v1.0
---------
Similar to UNIX (and SKsh) command of same name, this displays time
taken for a command to run.

	Usage:	time <command>

If using under the OS2 shell, the command may also be an alias or a
script (with script bit set). The given command is executed, and when
finished, the time it took to run is displayed using the format HH:MM:SS.SS,
where (need I say) HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS.SS is seconds (with
hundredths). Source is included. AmigaDOS 2.0 required. Finally, this
program is pure and so can be made resident.
