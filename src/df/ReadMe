[1mOverview[0m
[1m-----------------------------------------------------------------[0m
This directory contains the following files:

- ReadMe (this file)
- ReadMe.info (icon)
- DMakefile (makefile for Aztec C)
- InfoQ.c (source code)
- InfoQ (executable)

To use [32;1mInfoQ[0m you have to work with:
- one Amiga running under at least AmigaOS 2.04.


[1mDescription[0m
[1m-----------------------------------------------------------------[0m
[32;1mInfoQ[0m  is a replacement for the original AmigaDOS 'info' command.
You  can  select  if  you  want  only  information about disks or
volumes  or even selected devices.  Another advantage is that the
columns 'size' and 'used' are printed no longer in blocks, but in
KBytes  or  MBytes,  so  you  don't have to know how long a block
actually  is on a specific device.  For volumes the creation date
is printed additionally.


[1mStart from Shell[0m
[1m-----------------------------------------------------------------[0m
You  can  start  [32;1mInfoQ[0m  only  from  shell, since it a DOS command
(except  for  the  possibility to start it from Workbench through
the menu item 'Execute Command...').

The  format  is  »InfoQ  DISKS/S,VOLS=VOLUMES/S,DEVICES/M«.  Each
parameter  is  optional.  If you don't give any parameter, you'll
get  full  information.   If you provide one or more device names
like DF0:  you will get only information for that one(s).  If you
invoke  [32;1mInfoQ[0m  with  the keywords VOLUMES or DEVICES, you'll only
get  information  from  these  ones.  The keyword VOLS is only an
abbreviation for VOLUMES.
