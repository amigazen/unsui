  Hi,  
    This is my 1st posting of a source to the net, it's not much, but
    I find it useful.  The program will copy lot's of files with a little
    less painfull syntax then the standard COPY program.  It's one of my
    1st real programs on the amiga ....   Some part's where taken from
    Matt Dillon's shell (use it all the time, its great - thanx matt).

    Happy hackin'
