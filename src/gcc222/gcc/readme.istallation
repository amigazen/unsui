The programming system comes in several lha archives with the needed directory
structure. Simply make a directory (gccdir) and extract the archives in it.
Then add to your user-startup file:

assign gcc: gccdir
assign glib: gcc:glib
path gcc:bin add

Then make a directory named gcc:amiga_include, get from Cbm the Amiga OS
include files and put them in that directory.

That's all folks.
