This is a simple MAN command, known from UNIX systems.
The advantage is, that it recognizes .guide files to be
AmigaGuide© documents. MAN then uses a different viewer
in order to display the AmigaGuide© document. Furthermore
MAN recognizes TeX-DVI files as well, using a different
viewer to display them. You may configure MAN using
environment variables.
