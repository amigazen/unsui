       To strip symbol and debug hunks from load files.

       SSttrriipp  removes all symbol and debug hunks from binary load
       files, i.e., executables.  These hunks  supplies  informa­
       tion  used  by,  for example, symbolic debuggers, but they
       are not loaded by the _A_m_i_g_a_D_O_S loader.  The size of a load
       file can often be reduced dramatically by removing them.

       SSttrriipp accepts the following arguments:

       FFIILLEE   The load file to be stripped.

       TTOO     The  stripped  version  of the load file. If the TTOO
              option isn't used, SSttrriipp will replace the  original
              file  with  the  stripped output. If a directory is
              given as the TTOO argument, the stripped output  will
              be  written to that directory with the _s_a_m_e name as
              the original file.

       QQUUIIEETT  tells SSttrriipp to keep its mouth shut unless something
              goes awry.

       KKEEEEPP   tells SSttrriipp to keep the original unstripped version
              with a _._o_r_i_g extension. This will only happen if no
              destination   _n_a_m_e  was  given  and  the  file  was
              changed.

       The stripped output is given the same protection flags and
       comment,  if applicable, as the original file, except that
       the archived flag is cleared.

       Any hardlinks to the original file will be broken  if  the
       original file is replaced.

       The  current  version  of  SSttrriipp refuses to strip overlaid
       load files.
