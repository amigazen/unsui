NAME
     touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
     touch [-acfm] [-r reference-file] [-t MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]
     [-d      time]      [--time={atime,access,use,mtime,modify}]
     [--date=time] [--file=reference-file] [--no-create] file...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of touch.   touch
     changes the access and modification times of each given file
     to the current time.  Files that do not  exist  are  created
     empty.   If the first file name given would be a valid argu-
     ment to the -_t option and no timestamp is given with any  of
     the  -_d, -_r, or -_t options and the -- argument is not given,
     that argument is interpreted as the time for the other files
     instead of as a filename.

     If changing both the access and modification  times  to  the
     current time, touch can change the timestamps for files that
     the user running it does not own but  has  write  permission
     for.  Otherwise, the user must own the files.

  OPTIONS
     -_a, --_t_i_m_e=_a_t_i_m_e, --_t_i_m_e=_a_c_c_e_s_s, --_t_i_m_e=_u_s_e
          Change the access time only.

     -_c, --_n_o-_c_r_e_a_t_e
          Do not create files that do not exist.

     -_d, --_d_a_t_e _t_i_m_e
          Use _t_i_m_e (which  can  be  in  various  common  formats)
          instead  of  the  current  time.   It can contain month
          names, timezones, `am' and `pm', etc.

     -_f   Ignored; for compatibility with BSD versions of touch.

     -_m, --_t_i_m_e=_m_t_i_m_e, --_t_i_m_e=_m_o_d_i_f_y
          Change the modification time only.

     -_r, --_f_i_l_e _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e-_f_i_l_e
          Use the times of _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e-_f_i_l_e instead of the  current
          time.

     -_t _M_M_D_D_h_h_m_m[[_C_C]_Y_Y][._s_s]
          Use  the  argument  (months,  days,   hours,   minutes,
          optional  century  and years, optional seconds) instead
          of the current time.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
