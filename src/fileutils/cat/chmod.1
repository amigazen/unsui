NAME
     chmod - change the access permissions of files

SYNOPSIS
     chmod [-Rcfv] mode file...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.   chmod
     changes  the  permissions  of  each  given file according to
     _m_o_d_e, which can  be  either  a  symbolic  representation  of
     changes  to  make,  or  an octal number representing the bit
     pattern for the new permissions.

     The  format   of   a   symbolic   mode   is   `[ugoa...][[+-
     =][rwxXstugo...]...][,...]'.   Multiple  symbolic operations
     can be given, separated by commas.

     A combination of the letters `ugoa'  controls  which  users'
     access  to  the  file  will be changed: the user who owns it
     (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in
     the  file's  group  (o), or all users (a).  If none of these
     are given, the effect is as if `a' were given, but bits that
     are set in the umask are not affected.

     The operator `+' causes the permissions selected to be added
     to the existing permissions of each file; `-' causes them to
     be removed; and `=' causes them to be the  only  permissions
     that the file has.

     The letters `rwxXstugo' select the new permissions  for  the
     affected  users: read (r), write (w), execute (or access for
     directories) (x), execute only if the file is a directory or
     already  has  execute permission for some user (X), set user
     or group ID on execution (s), save program text on swap dev-
     ice  (t),  the  permissions  that the user who owns the file
     currently has for it (u), the permissions that  other  users
     in  the  file's  group  have for it (g), and the permissions
     that other users not in the file's group have for it (o).

     A numeric mode is from  one  to  four  octal  digits  (0-7),
     derived  by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Any
     omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.   The  first
     digit  selects  the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and
     save text image (1) attributes.  The  second  digit  selects
     permissions  for the user who owns the file: read (4), write
     (2), and execute (1);  the  third  selects  permissions  for
     other  users  in the file's group, with the same values; and
     the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the
     same values.

     chmod ignores symbolic links; the chmod system  call  cannot
     change  their  permissions.  This is not a problem since the

     permissions of symbolic links are never used.
