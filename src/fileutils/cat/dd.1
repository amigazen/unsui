NAME
     dd - convert a file while copying it

SYNOPSIS
     dd [if=file] [of=file]  [ibs=bytes]  [obs=bytes]  [bs=bytes]
     [cbs=bytes]   [skip=blocks]   [seek=blocks]   [count=blocks]
     [conv={ascii,ebcdic,ibm,block,unblock,lcase,ucase,swab,noerror,notrunc,
     sync}]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of dd.  dd copies
     a  file  (from the standard input to the standard output, by
     default) with a user-selectable blocksize, while  optionally
     performing conversions on it.

  OPTIONS
     Numbers can be followed by a multiplier:
     b=512, k=1024, w=2, xm=number m

     _i_f=_f_i_l_e
          Read from _f_i_l_e instead of the standard input.

     _o_f=_f_i_l_e
          Write to _f_i_l_e instead of the standard  output.   Unless
          _c_o_n_v=_n_o_t_r_u_n_c is given, truncate _f_i_l_e to the size speci-
          fied by _s_e_e_k= (0 bytes if _s_e_e_k= is not given).

     _i_b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
          Read _b_y_t_e_s bytes at a time.

     _o_b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
          Write _b_y_t_e_s bytes at a time.

     _b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
          Read and write _b_y_t_e_s bytes at atime.  Override ibs  and
          obs.

     _c_b_s=_b_y_t_e_s
          Convert _b_y_t_e_s bytes at a time.

     _s_k_i_p=_b_l_o_c_k_s
          Skip _b_l_o_c_k_s ibs-sized blocks at start of input.

     _s_e_e_k=_b_l_o_c_k_s
          Skip _b_l_o_c_k_s obs-sized blocks at start of output.

     _c_o_u_n_t=_b_l_o_c_k_s
          Copy only _b_l_o_c_k_s ibs-sized input blocks.

     _c_o_n_v=_c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n[,_c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n...]
          Convert the file as specified by the  _c_o_n_v_e_r_s_i_o_n  argu-
          ments.

          Conversions:

          ascii
               Convert EBCDIC to ASCII.

          ebcdic
               Convert ASCII to EBCDIC.

          ibm  Convert ASCII to alternate EBCDIC.

          block
               Pad newline-terminated records  to  size  of  cbs,
               replacing newline with trailing spaces.

          unblock
               Replace trailing spaces in  cbs-sized  block  with
               newline.

          lcase
               Change uppercase characters to lowercase.

          ucase
               Change lowercase characters to uppercase.

          swab Swap every pair of input bytes.  Unlike  the  Unix
               dd,  this  works  when  an odd number of bytes are
               read.  If the input file contains an odd number of
               bytes, the last byte is simply copied (since there
               is nothing to swap it with).

          noerror
               Continue after read errors.

          notrunc
               Do not truncate the output file.

          sync Pad every input block to size of ibs with trailing
               NULs.
