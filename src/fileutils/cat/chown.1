NAME
     chown - change the user and group ownership of files

SYNOPSIS
     chown [-Rcfv] [--recursive] [--changes] [--silent] [--quiet]
     [--verbose] [user][:.][group] file...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of chown.   chown
     changes  the user and/or group ownership of each given file,
     according to its first non-option argument, which is  inter-
     preted as follows.  If only a user name (or numeric user ID)
     is given, that user is made the owner of  each  given  file,
     and  the  files'  group is not changed.  If the user name is
     followed by a colon or dot and  a  group  name  (or  numeric
     group  ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership
     of the files is changed as well.  If a colon or dot  but  no
     group  name  follows  the  user  name, that user is made the
     owner of the files and the group of the files is changed  to
     that  user's login group.  If the colon or dot and group are
     given, but the user name is omitted, only the group  of  the
     files  is  changed;  in  this  case, chown performs the same
     function as chgrp.

  OPTIONS
     -_c, --_c_h_a_n_g_e_s
          Verbosely describe only files whose ownership  actually
          changes.

     -_f, --_s_i_l_e_n_t, --_q_u_i_e_t
          Do not print error messages about files whose ownership
          cannot be changed.

     -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
          Verbosely describe ownership changes.

     -_R, --_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
          Recursively change ownership of directories  and  their
          contents.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
