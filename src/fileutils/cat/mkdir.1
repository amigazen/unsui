NAME
     mkdir - make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-p] [-m mode] [--path] [--mode=mode] dir...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of mkdir.   mkdir
     creates  a  directory with each given name.  By default, the
     mode of created directories is 0777 minus the  bits  set  in
     the umask.

  OPTIONS
     -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
          Set the mode of created directories to _m_o_d_e,  which  is
          symbolic  as  in chmod and uses the default mode as the
          point of departure.

     -_p, --_p_a_t_h
          Ensure that each given path exists.  Make  any  missing
          parent  directories  for  each argument.  Parent direc-
          tories default to the umask modified by `u+wx'.  Do not
          consider  an  argument directory that already exists to
          be an error.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
