MKFIFO(1L)        MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES         MKFIFO(1L)



NAME
     mkfifo - make FIFOs (named pipes)

SYNOPSIS
     mkfifo [-m mode] [--mode=mode] path...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  mkfifo.
     mkfifo creates a FIFO with each given name.  By default, the
     mode of created FIFOs is 0666 minus  the  bits  set  in  the
     umask.

  OPTIONS
     -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
          Set the mode of created FIFOs to _m_o_d_e,  which  is  sym-
          bolic  as  in  chmod  and  uses the default mode as the
          point of departure.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
