NAME
     chgrp - change the group ownership of files

SYNOPSIS
     chgrp [-Rcfv] [--recursive] [--changes] [--silent] [--quiet]
     [--verbose] group file...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of chgrp.   chgrp
     changes  the group ownership of each given file to the named
     group, which can be either a group name or a  numeric  group
     ID.

  OPTIONS
     -_c, --_c_h_a_n_g_e_s
          Verbosely describe only files whose ownership  actually
          changes.

     -_f, --_s_i_l_e_n_t, --_q_u_i_e_t
          Do not print error messages about files whose ownership
          cannot be changed.

     -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
          Verbosely describe ownership changes.

     -_R, --_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
          Recursively change ownership of directories  and  their
          contents.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
