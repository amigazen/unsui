NAME
     df - summarize free disk space

SYNOPSIS
     df [-aikPv] [-t fstype] [--all] [--inodes]  [--type  fstype]
     [--kilobytes] [--portability] [path...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  df.   df
     displays  the amount of disk space available on the filesys-
     tem containing each argument pathname.  If no pathnames  are
     given, the space available on all currently mounted filesys-
     tems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by default,
     unless  the  environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in
     which case 512-byte blocks are used.

     If an argument is the full pathname of a  disk  device  node
     containing  a  mounted filesystem, df shows the space avail-
     able on that filesystem rather than on the  filesystem  con-
     taining  the  device node (which is always the root filesys-
     tem).  This version of df can not show the  space  available
     on  unmounted  filesystems, because on most kinds of systems
     doing so requires very  nonportable  intimate  knowledge  of
     filesystem structures.

  OPTIONS
     -_a, --_a_l_l
          Include in the listing filesystems that have 0  blocks,
          which  are  omitted  by  default.  Such filesystems are
          typically special-purpose pseudo-filesystems,  such  as
          automounter  entries.   On some systems, filesystems of
          type ``ignore'' or ``auto'' are also omitted by default
          and included in the listing by this option.

     -_i, --_i_n_o_d_e_s
          List inode usage information instead  of  block  usage.
          An  inode  (short for ``index node'') is a special kind
          of disk block that contains information about  a  file,
          such  as  its owner, permissions, timestamps, and loca-
          tion on the disk.

     -_k, --_k_i_l_o_b_y_t_e_s
          Print sizes in 1K blocks instead  of  512-byte  blocks.
          This     overrides     the     environment     variable
          POSIXLY_CORRECT.

     -_P, --_p_o_r_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y
          Use the POSIX output format.  This is like the  default
          format  except that the information about each filesys-
          tem is always printed on exactly one line; a mount dev-
          ice  is never put on a line by itself.  This means that
          if the mount device name is  more  than  20  characters

          long  (as  for  some  network  mounts), the columns are
          misaligned.

     -_t, --_t_y_p_e _f_s_t_y_p_e
          Limit the listing to filesystems of type _f_s_t_y_p_e.   Mul-
          tiple  filesystem types can be shown by giving multiple
          -_t options.   By  default,  all  filesystem  types  are
          listed.

     -_v   Ignored; for compatibility with System  V  versions  of
          df.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
