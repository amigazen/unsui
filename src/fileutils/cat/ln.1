     {numbered,existing,simple}]                      [--version-
     control={numbered,existing,simple}] [--backup] [--directory]

     [--suffix=backup-suffix]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of  ln.   If  the
     last  argument  names  an  existing directory, ln links each
     other given file into a file with  the  same  name  in  that
     directory.   If  only  one file is given, it links that file
     into the current directory.  Otherwise, if  only  two  files
     are  given,  it  links  the first onto the second.  It is an
     error if the last argument is not a directory and more  than
     two  files  are  given.  It makes hard links by default.  By
     default, it does not remove existing files.

  OPTIONS
     -_b, --_b_a_c_k_u_p
          Make backups of files that are about to be removed.

     -_d, -_F, --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          Allow the super-user to make hard links to directories.

     -_f, --_f_o_r_c_e
          Remove existing destination files.

     -_i, --_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e
          Prompt whether to remove existing destination files.

     -_s, --_s_y_m_b_o_l_i_c
          Make symbolic links instead of hard links.

     -_v, --_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
          Print the name of each file before linking it.

     -_S, --_s_u_f_f_i_x _b_a_c_k_u_p-_s_u_f_f_i_x
          The suffix used for making simple backup files  can  be
          set with the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment variable,
          which can be overridden by this option.  If neither  of
          those is given, the default is `~', as it is in Emacs.

     '-_V, --_v_e_r_s_i_o_n-_c_o_n_t_r_o_l {_n_u_m_b_e_r_e_d,_e_x_i_s_t_i_n_g,_s_i_m_p_l_e}"
          The  type  of  backups  made  can  be  set   with   the
          VERSION_CONTROL  environment  variable,  which  can  be

          overridden by this option.  If VERSION_CONTROL  is  not
          set  and  this  option is not given, the default backup
          type is `existing'.  The value of  the  VERSION_CONTROL
          environment  variable  and  the argument to this option
          are like the GNU Emacs `version-control' variable; they
          also recognize synonyms that are more descriptive.  The
          valid values are (unique abbreviations are accepted):

          `t' or `numbered'
               Always make numbered backups.

          `nil' or `existing'
               Make numbered backups of files that  already  have
               them, simple backups of the others.

          `never' or `simple'
               Always make simple backups.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
