NAME
     install - copy files and set their attributes

SYNOPSIS
     install [options] [-s] [--strip] source dest
     install [options] [-s] [--strip] source... directory
     install [options] [-d,--directory] directory...
     Options:
     [-c]  [-g  group]  [-m  mode]  [-o  owner]   [--group=group]
     [--mode=mode] [--owner=owner]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  install.
     install copies files and sets their permission modes and, if
     possible, their owner and group.  Used similarly to cp; typ-
     ically  used in Makefiles to copy programs into their desti-
     nation directories.  It can also be used to create the  des-
     tination directories and any leading directories, and to set
     the final directory's modes.  It refuses to copy files  onto
     themselves.

  OPTIONS
     -_c   Ignored; for compatibility with old  Unix  versions  of
          install.

     -_d, --_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          Create each given  directory  and  its  leading  direc-
          tories,  if  they do not already exist.  Set the owner,
          group and mode as given on the command line or  to  the
          defaults.   Also gives any leading directories that are
          created those attributes.  This is different  from  the
          SunOS  4.x  _i_n_s_t_a_l_l,  which  gives  directories that it
          creates the default attributes.

     -_g, --_g_r_o_u_p _g_r_o_u_p
          Set the group ownership of the installed file or direc-
          tory  to  the  group  ID of _g_r_o_u_p (default is process's
          current group). _g_r_o_u_p may also be a numeric group ID.

     -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
          Set the permission  mode  for  the  installed  file  or
          directory to _m_o_d_e, which can be either an octal number,
          or a symbolic mode as in chmod, with 0 as the point  of
          departure.  The default mode is 0755.

     -_o, --_o_w_n_e_r _o_w_n_e_r
          If run as root, set the ownership of the installed file
          to  the  user  ID of _o_w_n_e_r (default is root). _o_w_n_e_r may
          also be a numeric user ID.

     -_s, --_s_t_r_i_p
          Strip the symbol tables from installed programs.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
