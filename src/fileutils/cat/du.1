NAME
     du - summarize disk usage

SYNOPSIS
     du [-abcklsxDLS] [--all] [--total]  [--count-links]  [--sum-
     marize]    [--bytes]    [--kilobytes]    [--one-file-system]
     [--separate-dirs]    [--dereference]    [--dereference-args]
     [path...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  du.   du
     displays  the amount of disk space used by each argument and
     for each subdirectory of directory arguments.  The space  is
     measured  in  1K  blocks  by default, unless the environment
     variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is  set,  in  which  case  512-byte
     blocks are used.

  OPTIONS
     -_a, --_a_l_l
          Display counts for all files, not just directories.

     -_b, --_b_y_t_e_s
          Print sizes in bytes.

     -_c, --_t_o_t_a_l
          Write a grand total of all of the arguments  after  all
          arguments  have  been  processed.   This can be used to
          find out the disk usage of a directory, with some files
          excluded.

     -_k, --_k_i_l_o_b_y_t_e_s
          Print sizes in kilobytes.  This overrides the  environ-
          ment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT.

     -_l, --_c_o_u_n_t-_l_i_n_k_s
          Count the size of all files, even if they have appeared
          already in another hard link.

     -_s, --_s_u_m_m_a_r_i_z_e
          Display only a total for each argument.

     -_x, --_o_n_e-_f_i_l_e-_s_y_s_t_e_m
          Skip directories that are on different filesystems from
          the one that the argument being processed is on.

     -_D, --_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e-_a_r_g_s
          Dereference symbolic links that are command line  argu-
          ments.   Does not affect other symbolic links.  This is
          helpful for finding out the disk usage  of  directories
          like /usr/tmp where they are symbolic links.

     -_L, --_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e

          Dereference symbolic links (show the disk space used by
          the  file  or directory that the link points to instead
          of the space used by the link).

     -_S, --_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_e-_d_i_r_s
          Count  the  size  of  each  directory  separately,  not
          including the sizes of subdirectories.

BUGS
     On BSD systems, du reports sizes that are half  the  correct
     values  for  files  that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems.
     On HP-UX systems,  it  reports  sizes  that  are  twice  the
     correct  values for files that are NFS-mounted from BSD sys-
     tems.  This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also  affects  the
     HP-UX du program.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
