NAME
     rmdir - remove empty directories

SYNOPSIS
     rmdir [-p] [--path] dir...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of rmdir.   rmdir
     removes each given empty directory.  If any non-option argu-
     ment does not refer to an existing empty directory, it is an
     error.

  OPTIONS
     -_p, --_p_a_t_h
          Remove any parent directories that are explicitly  men-
          tioned  in  an argument, if they become empty after the
          argument file is removed.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
