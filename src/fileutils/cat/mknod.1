NAME
     mknod - make special files

SYNOPSIS
     mknod [-m mode] [--mode=mode] path {bcu} major minor
     mknod [-m mode] [--mode=mode] path p

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of mknod.   mknod
     creates  a  FIFO,  character  special file, or block special
     file with the given  pathname.   By  default,  the  mode  of
     created files is 0666 minus the bits set in the umask.

     The argument after the path specifies the type  of  file  to
     make:
     p for a FIFO
     b for a block (buffered) special file
     c or u for a character (unbuffered) special file

     When making a block or character special file, the major and
     minor device numbers must be given after the file type.

  OPTIONS
     -_m, --_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
          Set the mode of created files to _m_o_d_e,  which  is  sym-
          bolic  as  in  chmod  and  uses the default mode as the
          point of departure.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
