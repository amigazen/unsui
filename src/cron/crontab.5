.SH NOTES
.PP
The cron daemon checks the crontab file every minute, so changes take
effect within one minute of saving the file.
.PP
Commands are executed using the Amiga CLI "RUN" command. The output
will be visible in the cron window.
.PP
If a command takes longer than one minute to execute, it may affect
the timing of subsequent scheduled tasks.
.PP
The daemon automatically adjusts for month length and leap years.
.PP
Weekday and day fields are independent. If both are specified, the
command will run when either condition is met.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The crontab file must be readable by the cron daemon.
.PP
Commands that require user interaction will not work properly.
.PP
Environment variables are not automatically set for cron jobs.
