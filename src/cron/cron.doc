CRON COMMAND DOCUMENTATION
==========================

NAME
    cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands

SYNOPSIS
    cron [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [crontab_file]

DESCRIPTION
    cron is a daemon that executes scheduled commands at specified times.
    It reads commands from a crontab file and executes them at the
    appropriate intervals.

    The daemon wakes up every minute to check for scheduled tasks and runs
    commands that match the current time. It continues running until
    terminated.

    If no crontab file is specified, the default file S:CronTab is used.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Display help information and exit.

    -v, --version
        Display version information and exit.

CRONTAB FORMAT
    The crontab file contains one job per line with the following format:

        minute hour day month weekday command

    Each field must be separated by spaces or tabs. The fields are:

    minute   Minute of the hour (0-59)
    hour     Hour of the day (0-23)
    day      Day of the month (1-31)
    month    Month of the year (1-12)
    weekday  Day of the week (0-6, where 0=Sunday)
    command  Command to execute (runs as if typed in CLI)

    Each field can contain:

    *       Any value (matches all possible values)
    ,       List of values (e.g., "1,3,5")
    -       Range of values (e.g., "1-5")
    /       Step values (e.g., "*/15" for every 15th value)

EXAMPLES
    * * * * * date
        Run the date command every minute

    0 * * * * echo 'Hourly check'
        Run echo command at the top of every hour

    30 2 * * * backup
        Run backup command daily at 2:30 AM

    0 9 * * 1 weekly_report
        Run weekly_report command every Monday at 9:00 AM

    */15 9-17 * * 1-5 business_check
        Run business_check every 15 minutes during business hours
        (9 AM to 5 PM), Monday through Friday

    0 1 1,15 * * monthly_maintenance
        Run monthly_maintenance on the 1st and 15th of each month
        at 1:00 AM

COMMON PATTERNS
    0 * * * *        Every hour at the top of the hour
    0 0 * * *        Every day at midnight
    0 0 * * 0        Every Sunday at midnight
    0 0 1 * *        First day of every month at midnight
    0 0 1 1 *        New Year's Day at midnight
    0 9-17 * * 1-5   Every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays

FILES
    S:CronTab         Default crontab file location
    /tmp/crontab      Alternative crontab file location

STARTUP CONFIGURATION
    To run cron automatically on system startup, add to your
    startup-sequence file:

        run newcli con:0/140/160/50/CronTask s:startcron

    Where s:startcron contains:

        cron

    This creates a dedicated CLI window for cron tasks and launches the
    daemon.

SIGNALS
    cron responds to the following signals:

    SIGINT  (Ctrl-C) Gracefully terminate the daemon
    SIGTERM          Terminate the daemon

EXIT STATUS
    0      Successful completion
    1      Error occurred (e.g., cannot open crontab file)

NOTES
    The daemon aligns itself to start on minute boundaries and compensates
    for execution time to maintain accurate timing.

    Commands are executed using the Amiga CLI "RUN" command, so output
    will be visible in the cron window.

    The daemon uses the Amiga.lib TimeDelay API for precise timing, which
    is more accurate than the standard Delay() function.

LIMITATIONS
    Since this is a multi-tasking system, timing delays may be
    approximate under heavy system load.

    Long-running commands may affect the timing accuracy of subsequent
    scheduled tasks.

    The crontab file must be readable by the cron daemon.

    Commands that require user interaction will not work properly.

    Environment variables are not automatically set for cron jobs.

    The daemon does not support the "%" character for newlines in
    commands.

TROUBLESHOOTING
    If cron is not running:
        - Check that the crontab file exists and is readable
        - Verify the cron daemon is started
        - Check for error messages in the cron window

    If commands are not executing:
        - Verify the crontab syntax is correct
        - Check that commands exist and are executable
        - Ensure the cron window is not blocked by user input

    If timing is inaccurate:
        - The system may be under heavy load
        - Long-running commands may affect timing
        - Restart the daemon to reset timing alignment

HISTORY
    The original AmiCron was developed by Steve R. Sampson in 1987 and
    released into the public domain. Rick Schaeffer ported it to the
    Amiga in October 1987. Christian Balzer made further improvements
    through versions 2.31-2.5 (1987-1988).

    This POSIX-compliant version was created for the unsui POSIX runtime
    environment, maintaining compatibility with the original AmiCron
    functionality while adapting it for modern Amiga systems.
