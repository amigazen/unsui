Status: O

Fred,

I just got your note that you posted on comp.sys.amiga.misc.  I tried
sending you this archive quite a while ago to fnf@fishpond.uucp, but I
guess you never got it.  Here it is again (sent to
fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com), an update to my Eval program, Eval 1.13.
1.12's most serious problem was that I think I compiled the executable
in the archive for 68020/30/40 CPU's only.  This archive has a correctly
compiled executable, and it has an improvement in the handling of
command line arguments.

Thanks for including Eval 1.12 on disk 857!
