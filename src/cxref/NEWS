Version 1.4a of cxref unreleased : Thu Nov 20 20:30:00 1997
-----------------------------------------------------------

The patches that made it onto the cxref bug-fix web-page.
  bug in -CPP option, 'volatile const' and 'const volatile' types, stopped
  crashes due to NULL pointer access, made the makefile work better on certain
  UNIX versions.

Added a -no-comments option.
Make the comment mangler better so that lines with just whitespace are emptied.

Allow blank lines and comments in the .cxref file.


Version 1.4 of cxref released : Sat Jul 5 18:30:00 1997
-------------------------------------------------------

Included a shell script to replace gcc to compile and cross-reference in one go.
Added in the option to change directory before running cxref.
Added a config file called .cxref that can contain command line arguments.

Changed the way that included variables and functions are dealt with.
  Functions and variables that are included as static or global so that they
  would be in the object file when compiled are listed as belonging to the file
  with a pointer to the header file that they were included from.

Added in a way to allow extended markup (HTML or LaTeX) inside comments.

Major re-write of the internals to increase maintainability & readability.

Added in -verbatim-comments to preserve formatting of comments in output.
Added in -block-comments to strip leading character from boxed comments.
Added an option to allow files to be deleted from the cross reference output.

Changed over to GCC V 2.7.2, reduced the patch size by moving stuff to cxref.
Added in a new command line option to pass extra arguments to the pre-processor.

Fixed the rest of the bug reports that made it onto the cxref bug-fix web-page.


Version 1.3a of cxref unreleased : Wed Apr 23 20:00:00 1997
-----------------------------------------------------------

The patches that made it onto the cxref bug-fix web-page.


Version 1.3 of cxref released : Sun Dec 8 10:30:00 1996
-------------------------------------------------------

Added manual pages for the programs.

Use the Linux Kernel source code to test the parser.
 Added more GNU C extensions.
 Fixed more errors in type names used as identifiers.

Added the ability to parse C++ comments (not for documenting).


Version 1.3-beta of cxref released : Sat Nov 16 16:30:00 1996
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a consolidation of versions 1.2, 1.2a, 1.2b plus trivial changes.

Fixed some remaining problems with implicit integer types and type qualifiers.

HTML output conforms to HTML 2.0 standard, and passes weblint test.
HTML, LaTeX and raw outputs have ';'s added in structure defintions.

Updated FAQ, added FAQ -> html conversion script, updated README, README.html
 and README.tex, added TODO.

The cxref-cpp program now does not need machine specific hand customisation.

Improved the Makefiles to simplify the installation:
 Fully automatic configuring of cxref-cpp, all build options in a single
 Makefile configuration file, installation included.


Version 1.2b of cxref released : Sat Oct 5 13:30:00 1996
---------------------------------------------------------

Function definitions included from header files do not cause cxref to core dump.
Removed dangling cross-references for referenced vars/funcs in the output.
Function prototypes within function definitions do not cause loss of references.
Typedefs of function types now recognised when used as prototypes.
Comments for nested struct/union types now work and the output format changed.
The option -warn-xref depends on -xref, warns user if used wrongly but works OK.
The index in the cxref.html file is now always at the end in the correct place.
The LaTeX output is centred on the page correctly.

The cxref-cpp program no longer aborts on certain files in multi-directory
 source trees, and if the preprocessor does abort then cxref tidies up cleanly.

The cxref-query program no longer core dumps on certain cross-references.


Version 1.2a of cxref released : Sat Aug 17 13:00:00 1996
---------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes in the parser for obscure C syntax:
 Type names used as identifiers, pointer to function used as a function
 argument, some K&R style function definitions, complete set of integer type
 names, more GCC extensions.


Version 1.2 of cxref released : Sat Jul  6 20:00:00 1996
--------------------------------------------------------

A FAQ is provided with common questions and answers to provide help.

Major revision of parsing code, especially for function definitions.
Labeled statements do not need a ';' (e.g. default in switch statement).
Better handling of traditional style function definitions
Variables declared extern within a function recognised and referenced.
Numerous minor bugs in parsing corrected.

Line number and file name information available in case of parse error.
Parse errors are handled gracefully, the program does not just exit.

Create sub-directories of the output directory as needed.
Better handling of include pathnames in cxref-cpp, for subdirectories.

Added a cxref.sty LaTeX style file instead of at the top of the main file.
The output files are not compatible with Version 1.1 output files.


Version 1.1 of cxref released : Wed May 22 19:00:00 1996
--------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a number of bugs in the 'front-end' of the program.

Makefile changed to make ANSI compatible latex-style.c source file.

Lexical analyser code fixed to work with a POSIX lex program.
GNU __attribute__ & __extension__ compiler directives handled better.

Better debugging options for the parser.
Bit-fields now parsed correctly and recognised as such in output.
Enum typedefs allowed to have a trailing comma.
Function definitions with no return type are now recognised as int and those
with no arguments recognised as void.
Allows the asm() GNU extension.

Fixed a problem with #include confusion with mix of global and local files.


Version 1.0 of cxref released : Sat Feb 24 16:30:00 1996
--------------------------------------------------------

A program that can automatically generate documentation and cross references for
a C program.

The input is any C program with appropriate comments and the output is LaTeX or
HTML files.

The documentation for the program is produced from comments in the code that are
appropriately formatted.  The cross referencing comes from the code itself and
requires no extra work.
